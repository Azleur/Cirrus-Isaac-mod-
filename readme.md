![mod thumbnail](thumb.jpg)

This repository contains the code and images used for my Binding of Isaac mod "Cirrus" ([Steam workshop link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=853687740)), a parodic character based off Final Fantasy VII's protagonist Cloud Strife. Some helper batch files and Python scripts used for publishing and testing the mod have been ommited, as well as the Photoshop files and reference images.
